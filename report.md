# G14C_Pharmacy_Inventory_Management_System


# **Introduction about system**

*	In the pharmacy environment, inventory refers to all of the medications and medical supplies used in daily operation of a pharmacy. The management of inventory comprises a large portion of the pharmacy technician’s responsibilities. It is essential to ensure there is an adequate stock of medications and supplies to serve the needs of the patients a pharmacy serves, and careful inventory management can also increase the profitability of a pharmacy. The level of pharmacy technician involvement in inventory management varies based on the facility, and can range from basic ordering and restocking in a retail pharmacy to purchasing and maintaining the inventory of all medications for a hospital. Despite the variety in responsibility level and location-specific considerations, the general principles of pharmacy inventory management remain the same. This course will review basic inventory management terminology and procedures for the pharmacy technician.

*	Pharmacy inventory system today are looking for opportunities to improve their daily operations effiencies by reducing costs without effecting patient care. In addition, for these system to function better they require accurate medical supply and equipment orders, tailored to the patient’s needs, and delivered on-time. Inventory is a subject in business that is hope can maximize profit. However, in many cases inventory has turned into a major cash flow constraint that cause necessary to optimize inventory using analytical and statistical methods in manual approach that is using papers. This will lead to paper wastage. In pharmacy industries, inventory management system can handle their inventory especially in pharmacy department. This includes all the activities that run in a pharmacy such as transaction, order items, and generate reports.


# **Objective of the project**

*	To help manage the re-order activities and control inventory stock balance.

*	To enable admin review any activities history.

*	To provide a better security for pharmacy inventory management system by develop a system with different level of authorization.

*	To save man power and on the same time increase the daily activities by improve the graphical user interface.

*	To build an inventory system that includes transaction process, so it will enable to calculate the stock balance.

*	Decreasing the carrying cost of maintaining an inventory. 

*	Lowering costs of ordering medications from wholesalers. 

*	Ensuring minimal time is spent ordering medications and purchasing tasks. 

*	Decreasing total costs to the pharmacy and overall health care organization by focusing on purchasing products with the lowest cost.


# **Scope of the project**

*	The system that is going to be develop is a LAN network based system where it will be placed on a computer in a pharmacy to help them manage their inventory. Here are the scopes for this system that can be divided into 2 group:

    1.	Users     
        The targets user for this system is the department manager as admin and pharmacy staff that will use this system to manage their activities in managing pharmacies inventories.

    2.	System      
        This is a LAN network based system which will be built using php , html , and xampp. The modules that includes in this system are:

          * Search for stock    
            Each store pharmacy can request for the medicine by inserting the information into the system.

          *	Add Entry                       
            If customers decide to return the medicine. Staff can re-enter the quantity of stock based on what the customers decide to return to the store.

          *	Sales transaction                                       
            In order to manage the inventory stock, this system will be able to manage the system intelligence to auto detect or check the stocks.

          *	Inventory adjustment                                            
            Admin can adjust inventory returned or received by the pharmacy for a number of reasons: restock / expired / destroyed.


# **System Requirement**

#### *Hardware*
 To apply the system, a basic computer can be used for pharmacy staffs and system admin to check the record of stock and update it. A network setup is required to connect the computer to database.

  *	Windows Operating System computer.
  *	A server to store all information into database.
  *	Keyboard
  *	Mouse
  *	Monitor


#### *Software*
The system are still in early phase, some prototype have been develop to test efficiency of the software. Team member are using a web based platform to communicate through each other to complete the system.There are few software involve in the prototyping phase.

*	phpMyadmin
*	Xampp
*	Php
*	Html
*	Atom
*	Github


# **Design Issues**

*	The issues is admin need to key in day, month and year. Admin also can’t sign in as a staff with the same username and password that admin use to sign in as a admin. If admin want to sign in as a staff, admin need to create a new ID to sign in. Staff can’t sign as admin because only one person can control the system. It had something for the staff or users use this system when the design add item and add user just only finished with not satisfied notification. Staff also only have two option on the system.  


# **Implementation**

* Please refer to the printscreen folder.


# **Contribution of the project**

*	With the proposed system  inventory, the pharmacist will be able to monitor the movement of medicine with ease. It monitors the medicine movement out from  pharmacy. At any time, the pharmacist is able to find out the balance and the medicine’s movement  history. This will avoid under and over stocking of medicine in the pharmacy, thus lead to better inventory management and also cost management for the purchase of medicine.

*	Compared to the current manual system, the implementation  of pharmacy system  inventory will reduces the time spent for paperwork, leading to concentration on improving pharmaceutical care of customers, especially emphasis on customers counseling and customer medication monitoring. It will be greatly embraced by the pharmacy profession as it is one giant leap towards pharmaceutical care of customer.


# **Evaluation**

*	The system is not considered a 100% successful project. The lacks of security for the system still can be improve in the future to increase the efficiency. The database still need a lot of touch up to maintain data accuracy. 


# **Conclusion**

* Today, most of the pharmacy management system in Malaysia is using file system or it’s called manual system reports. Some changes need to be done to help them manage their inventory with more effective. A computerized system is the best solution. By changing to this technology, pharmacy is hoped will be able to adapt to current requirement that increase from day by day.
